# It's LeviOsa, not LevioSA
The poster focuses on the analysis of spells cast in the Harry Potter movie series. 
As part of our analysis, we concentrated on the number of spells cast throughout the Harry Potter film series, identifying Harry as the character who used the most spells. 
We analyzed the distribution of spells cast by him across the different movies. 
Additionally, we examined the colors of magic generated by wands with various cores.
The poster was created using the online tool Canva, and the charts were made in Rstudio using the R language.
