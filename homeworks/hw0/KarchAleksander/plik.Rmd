This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
proton()
```

```{r}
str(employees)
head(employees)
employees[employees$surname == "Pietraszko",]
```

```{r}
proton(action = "login", login = "johnins")
```

```{r}
c<-"lol"
i<-1
while(c != "Success! User is logged in!"){
  c<-proton(action = "login", login = "johnins", password = unique(top1000passwords)[i])
  i<- i + 1}
print(i-1)
```

```{r}
head(logs)
mod(logs[logs$login == "slap",]$host)
```
